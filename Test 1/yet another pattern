/*Problem statement
Ninja was playing with her sister to solve a puzzle pattern. However, even after taking several hours, they could not solve the problem.

A value of N is given to them, and they are asked to solve the problem. Since they are stuck for a while, they ask you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?

Example : Pattern for N = 4

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 300

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:

Explanation for Sample Input 1:
 In the first test case, the value of ‘N’ is 3, so three rows are to be printed from 1 to 3 where each row starts from 3, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [“***”,”**”,”*”].

 In the second test case, the value of ‘N’ is 2, so the two rows are to be printed from 1 to 3 where each row starts from 3, which goes on till 1. Hence the answer is [“**”,”*”].
Sample Input 2:

2
